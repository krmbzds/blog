I've released a new version of `turkish_id` gem.

Now, it supports querying ID numbers for people that are not a Turkish citizen but are registered in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Card_(Turkey)[blue card] registry. The numerical validation works the same way, so no differences there. There is a separate endpoint for querying ID numbers that are in the blue card registry; hence the new `foreigner_registered?` method. 

Here's how you can use it. First, create a new instance:

[source,rb]
----
identity_number = TurkishId.new("99911494534")
----

Use `valid?` method to check numerical validity:

[source,rb]
----
identity_number.valid?  #=> true
----

Use `foreigner_registered?` method to query the foreigner registry:

[source,rb]
----
identity_number.foreigner_registered?("Yukihiro", "Matsumoto", 14, 4, 1965)  #=> false
----

And that's how you can query a person with a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Card_(Turkey)[blue card]. Hope you find it helpful.

Happy hacking!
